# Lead-Score-Case-Study
**Problem Statement:** X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, faces challenges in converting leads generated from their website and various marketing channels. Despite attracting numerous potential customers, the lead conversion rate remains low, hovering around 30%. To enhance efficiency, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads,' with the expectation that focusing efforts on this subset will elevate the lead conversion rate to approximately 80%.
Your role is to build a model that assigns a lead score to each prospect, indicating the likelihood of conversion. A higher lead score signifies a greater chance of conversion, enabling the sales team to prioritize communication with the most prospective leads.

**Data:** The dataset provided contains around 9000 data points with attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. The target variable is 'Converted,' indicating whether a past lead was converted (1) or not (0).
It's crucial to address the 'Select' level present in many categorical variables, treating it as a null value to ensure accurate model development. The CEO envisions achieving an 80% lead conversion rate by leveraging insights from the dataset to identify and prioritize leads with the highest potential for conversion.

**Goals of the Case Study:** Develop a logistic regression model to assign lead scores ranging from 0 to 100, enabling the company to target potential leads effectively. A higher score indicates a hot lead with a higher likelihood of conversion, while a lower score suggests a cold lead less likely to convert. Ensure the model is adaptable to address additional challenges presented by the company in the future, as outlined in a separate document. Include these adjustments in the final presentation, along with recommendations based on the logistic regression model's insights.

**Results Expected:** Provide a well-documented Jupyter notebook featuring the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics. Include a Word document with solutions to all presented problems. The presentation should outline the overall analysis approach, touch upon the problem statement, and explain results in business terms using visualizations. Conclude with a brief 500-word summary report detailing the assignment's progression and key learnings.

**Documents Included:** The following have been included in the Case Study:
  1. A well documented Python file: **Lead_Scoring_Case_Study_AM_SP-Final.ipynb**
  2. The word document filled with solutions to all the problems: **Assignment Subjective Questions_AM_SP.pdf**
  3. A presentation file: **Presentation-Lead Scoring Case Study-AM-SP.pdf**
  4. A brief summary report in 500 words: Summary-Lead Scoring Case Study-AM-SP.pdf
